# TCP_Server_Client

A small experimental Project to get help getting started with Web-Socket Communication in C++ and understand the boost::asio library and its functions and dependencies.<br>
<br>
This Project implements a simple Server that recieves any Messages from a simple TCP Client on localhost and then answers. The Client revieves this answer and shuts down.<br>

## TODO
Hopefully implement this Websocket communication in Future Projects or even current Projects to increase functionality and use a Websocket-Communication in an actually practical way.
